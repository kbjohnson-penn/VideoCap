# Importing REDCap XML for CLIPS Survey

## Background
This survey was created using the REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at the University of Pennsylvania.<sup>1,2</sup> REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a secure, web-based software platform designed to support data capture for research studies, providing 1) an intuitive interface for validated data capture; 2) audit trails for tracking data manipulation and export procedures; 3) automated export procedures for seamless data downloads to common statistical packages; and 4) procedures for data integration and interoperability with external sources.

## Summary
REDCap allows exporting and importing of projects as XML files. These files include all instruments (surveys), questions, sections, and settings that have been configured for a project. The provided XML corresponds to the released CLIPS Survey, which is powered by the VideoCap workflow (a component of CLIPS within the REDUCE initiative).

## Steps to Import the XML File

### Upload XML Project File
1. **Log in to REDCap:**

2. **Create a New Project:**
   - Click "+New Project" on the REDCap toolbar.
   - Enter a Project Title, Purpose, and Notes.
   - Under Project Creation Option, check "Upload a REDCap project XML file (CDISC ODM format)".
   - Select the XML file downloaded from this repository.
   - Click "Create Project".
